It was a very nice learning experience to create a full stack web application from the ground up. It has been a pleasure to work with talented developers and project managers in the creation of this project. I have learned more about React, TypeScript, Chakra UI and Recoil. Working with Strapi has also been an interesting and learning experience!",
